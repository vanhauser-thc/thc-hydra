```


INTRODUCTION
------------
Number one of the biggest security holes are passwords, as every password
security study shows.
This tool is a proof of concept code, to give researchers and security
consultants the possibility to show how easy it would be to gain unauthorized
access from remote to a system.

THIS TOOL IS FOR LEGAL PURPOSES ONLY!

There are already several login hacker tools available, however, none does
either support more than one protocol to attack or support parallelized
connects.

It was tested to compile cleanly on Linux, Windows/Cygwin, Solaris,
FreeBSD/OpenBSD, QNX (Blackberry 10) and MacOS.

Currently this tool supports the following protocols:
 Asterisk, AFP, Cisco AAA, Cisco auth, Cisco enable, CVS, Firebird, FTP,
 HTTP-FORM-GET, HTTP-FORM-POST, HTTP-GET, HTTP-HEAD, HTTP-POST, HTTP-PROXY,
 HTTPS-FORM-GET, HTTPS-FORM-POST, HTTPS-GET, HTTPS-HEAD, HTTPS-POST,
 HTTP-Proxy, ICQ, IMAP, IRC, LDAP, MEMCACHED, MONGODB, MS-SQL, MYSQL, NCP, NNTP, Oracle Listener,
 Oracle SID, Oracle, PC-Anywhere, PCNFS, POP3, POSTGRES, Radmin, RDP, Rexec, Rlogin,
 Rsh, RTSP, SAP/R3, SIP, SMB, SMTP, SMTP Enum, SNMP v1+v2+v3, SOCKS5,
 SSH (v1 and v2), SSHKEY, Subversion, Teamspeak (TS2), Telnet, VMware-Auth,
 VNC and XMPP.

However the module engine for new services is very easy so it won't take a
long time until even more services are supported.
Your help in writing, enhancing or fixing modules is highly appreciated!! :-)



WHERE TO GET
------------
You can always find the newest release/production version of hydra at its
project page at https://github.com/vanhauser-thc/thc-hydra/releases
If you are interested in the current development state, the public development
repository is at Github:
  svn co https://github.com/vanhauser-thc/thc-hydra
 or
  git clone https://github.com/vanhauser-thc/thc-hydra
Use the development version at your own risk. It contains new features and
new bugs. Things might not work!

Alternatively (and easier) to can pull it as a docker container:
```
docker pull vanhauser/hydra
```


HOW TO COMPILE
--------------
To configure, compile and install hydra, just type:

```
./configure
make
make install
```

If you want the ssh module, you have to setup libssh (not libssh2!) on your
system,  get it from https://www.libssh.org, for ssh v1 support you also need
to add "-DWITH_SSH1=On" option in the cmake command line.
IMPORTANT: If you compile on MacOS then you must do this - do not install libssh via brew!

If you use Ubuntu/Debian, this will install supplementary libraries needed
for a few optional modules (note that some might not be available on your distribution):

```
apt-get install libssl-dev libssh-dev libidn11-dev libpcre3-dev \
                 libgtk2.0-dev libmysqlclient-dev libpq-dev libsvn-dev \
                 firebird-dev libmemcached-dev libgpg-error-dev \
                 libgcrypt11-dev libgcrypt20-dev freetds-dev
```

This enables all optional modules and features with the exception of Oracle,
SAP R/3, NCP and the apple filing protocol - which you will need to download and
install from the vendor's web sites.

For all other Linux derivates and BSD based systems, use the system
software installer and look for similarly named libraries like in the
command above. In all other cases, you have to download all source libraries
and compile them manually.



SUPPORTED PLATFORMS
-------------------
- All UNIX platforms (Linux, *BSD, Solaris, etc.)
- MacOS (basically a BSD clone)
- Windows with Cygwin (both IPv4 and IPv6)
- Mobile systems based on Linux, MacOS or QNX (e.g. Android, iPhone, Blackberry 10, Zaurus, iPaq)



HOW TO USE
----------
If you just enter `hydra`, you will see a short summary of the important
options available.
Type `./hydra -h` to see all available command line options.

Note that NO login/password file is included. Generate them yourself.
A default password list is however present, use "dpl4hydra.sh" to generate
a list.

For Linux users, a GTK GUI is available, try `./xhydra`

For the command line usage, the syntax is as follows:
 For attacking one target or a network, you can use the new "://" style:
  hydra [some command line options] PROTOCOL://TARGET:PORT/MODULE-OPTIONS
 The old mode can be used for these too, and additionally if you want to
 specify your targets from a text file, you *must* use this one:

```
hydra [some command line options] [-s PORT] TARGET PROTOCOL [MODULE-OPTIONS]
```

Via the command line options you specify which logins to try, which passwords,
if SSL should be used, how many parallel tasks to use for attacking, etc.

PROTOCOL is the protocol you want to use for attacking, e.g. ftp, smtp,
http-get or many others are available
TARGET is the target you want to attack
MODULE-OPTIONS are optional values which are special per PROTOCOL module

FIRST - select your target
 you have three options on how to specify the target you want to attack:
 1. a single target on the command line: just put the IP or DNS address in
 2. a network range on the command line: CIDR specification like "192.168.0.0/24"
 3. a list of hosts in a text file: one line per entry (see below)

SECOND - select your protocol
 Try to avoid telnet, as it is unreliable to detect a correct or false login attempt.
 Use a port scanner to see which protocols are enabled on the target.

THIRD - check if the module has optional parameters
 hydra -U PROTOCOL
 e.g. hydra -U smtp

FOURTH - the destination port
 this is optional, if no port is supplied the default common port for the
 PROTOCOL is used.
 If you specify SSL to use ("-S" option), the SSL common port is used by default.


If you use "://" notation, you must use "[" "]" brackets if you want to supply
IPv6 addresses or CIDR ("192.168.0.0/24") notations to attack:
  hydra [some command line options] ftp://[192.168.0.0/24]/
  hydra [some command line options] -6 smtps://[2001:db8::1]/NTLM

Note that everything hydra does is IPv4 only!
If you want to attack IPv6 addresses, you must add the "-6" command line option.
All attacks are then IPv6 only!

If you want to supply your targets via a text file, you can not use the ://
notation but use the old style and just supply the protocol (and module options):
  hydra [some command line options] -M targets.txt ftp
You can also supply the port for each target entry by adding ":<port>" after a
target entry in the file, e.g.:

```
foo.bar.com
target.com:21
unusual.port.com:2121
default.used.here.com
127.0.0.1
127.0.0.1:2121
```

Note that if you want to attach IPv6 targets, you must supply the -6 option
and *must* put IPv6 addresses in brackets in the file(!) like this:

```
foo.bar.com
target.com:21
[fe80::1%eth0]
[2001::1]
[2002::2]:8080
[2a01:24a:133:0:00:123:ff:1a]
```

LOGINS AND PASSWORDS
--------------------
You have many options on how to attack with logins and passwords
With -l for login and -p for password you tell hydra that this is the only
login and/or password to try.
With -L for logins and -P for passwords you supply text files with entries.
e.g.:

```
hydra -l admin -p password ftp://localhost/
hydra -L default_logins.txt -p test ftp://localhost/
hydra -l admin -P common_passwords.txt ftp://localhost/
hydra -L logins.txt -P passwords.txt ftp://localhost/
```

Additionally, you can try passwords based on the login via the "-e" option.
The "-e" option has three parameters:

```
s - try the login as password
n - try an empty password
r - reverse the login and try it as password
```

If you want to, e.g. try "try login as password and "empty password", you 
specify "-e sn" on the command line.

But there are two more modes for trying passwords than -p/-P:
You can use text file which where a login and password pair is separated by a colon,
e.g.:

```
admin:password
test:test
foo:bar
```

This is a common default account style listing, that is also generated by the
dpl4hydra.sh default account file generator supplied with hydra.
You use such a text file with the -C option - note that in this mode you
can not use -l/-L/-p/-P options (-e nsr however you can).
Example:

```
hydra -C default_accounts.txt ftp://localhost/
```

And finally, there is a bruteforce mode with the -x option (which you can not
use with -p/-P/-C):

```
-x minimum_length:maximum_length:charset
```

the charset definition is `a` for lowercase letters, `A` for uppercase letters,
`1` for numbers and for anything else you supply it is their real representation.
Examples:

```
-x 1:3:a generate passwords from length 1 to 3 with all lowercase letters
-x 2:5:/ generate passwords from length 2 to 5 containing only slashes
-x 5:8:A1 generate passwords from length 5 to 8 with uppercase and numbers
-x '3:3:aA1&~#\\ "\'<{([-|_^@)]=}>$%*?./ยง,;:!`' -v generates length 3 passwords with all 95 characters, and verbose. 
```

Example:

```
hydra -l ftp -x 3:3:a ftp://localhost/
```

SPECIAL OPTIONS FOR MODULES
---------------------------
Via the third command line parameter (TARGET SERVICE OPTIONAL) or the -m
command line option, you can pass one option to a module.
Many modules use this, a few require it!

To see the special option of a module, type:

  hydra -U <module>

e.g.

  ./hydra -U http-post-form

The special options can be passed via the -m parameter, as 3rd command line
option or in the service://target/option format.

Examples (they are all equal):

```
./hydra -l test -p test -m PLAIN 127.0.0.1 imap
./hydra -l test -p test 127.0.0.1 imap PLAIN
./hydra -l test -p test imap://127.0.0.1/PLAIN
```

RESTORING AN ABORTED/CRASHED SESSION
------------------------------------
When hydra is aborted with Control-C, killed or crashes, it leaves a
"hydra.restore" file behind which contains all necessary information to
restore the session. This session file is written every 5 minutes.
NOTE: the hydra.restore file can NOT be copied to a different platform (e.g.
from little endian to big endian, or from Solaris to AIX)

HOW TO SCAN/CRACK OVER A PROXY
------------------------------
The environment variable HYDRA_PROXY_HTTP defines the web proxy (this works
just for the http services!).
The following syntax is valid:

```
HYDRA_PROXY_HTTP="http://123.45.67.89:8080/"
HYDRA_PROXY_HTTP="http://login:password@123.45.67.89:8080/"
HYDRA_PROXY_HTTP="proxylist.txt"
```

The last example is a text file containing up to 64 proxies (in the same
format definition as the other examples).

For all other services, use the HYDRA_PROXY variable to scan/crack.
It uses the same syntax. eg:

```
HYDRA_PROXY=[connect|socks4|socks5]://[login:password@]proxy_addr:proxy_port
```

for example:

```
HYDRA_PROXY=connect://proxy.anonymizer.com:8000
HYDRA_PROXY=socks4://auth:pw@127.0.0.1:1080
HYDRA_PROXY=socksproxylist.txt
```

ADDITIONAL HINTS
----------------
* sort your password files by likelihood and use the -u option to find
  passwords much faster!
* uniq your dictionary files! this can save you a lot of time :-)
    cat words.txt | sort | uniq > dictionary.txt
* if you know that the target is using a password policy (allowing users
  only to choose a password with a minimum length of 6, containing a least one
  letter and one number, etc. use the tool pw-inspector which comes along
  with the hydra package to reduce the password list:
    cat dictionary.txt | pw-inspector -m 6 -c 2 -n > passlist.txt


RESULTS OUTPUT
--------------

The results are output to stdio along with the other information.  Via the -o
command line option, the results can also be written to a file.  Using -b,
the format of the output can be specified.  Currently, these are supported:

* `text`   - plain text format
* `jsonv1` - JSON data using version 1.x of the schema (defined below).
* `json`   - JSON data using the latest version of the schema, currently there
             is only version 1.

If using JSON output, the results file may not be valid JSON if there are
serious errors in booting Hydra.


JSON Schema
-----------
Here is an example of the JSON output.  Notes on some of the fields:

* `errormessages` - an array of zero or more strings that are normally printed
   to stderr at the end of the Hydra's run.  The text is very free form.
* `success` - indication if Hydra ran correctly without error (**NOT** if
   passwords were detected).  This parameter is either the JSON value `true`
   or `false` depending on completion.  
* `quantityfound` - How many username+password combinations discovered.
* `jsonoutputversion` - Version of the schema, 1.00, 1.01, 1.11, 2.00,
   2.03, etc.  Hydra will make second tuple of the version to always be two
   digits to make it easier for downstream processors (as opposed to v1.1 vs
   v1.10).  The minor-level versions are additive, so 1.02 will contain more
   fields than version 1.00 and will be backward compatible.  Version 2.x will
   break something from version 1.x output.  

Version 1.00 example:
```
{
    "errormessages": [
        "[ERROR] Error Message of Something",
        "[ERROR] Another Message",
        "These are very free form"
    ],
    "generator": {
        "built": "2021-03-01 14:44:22",
        "commandline": "hydra -b jsonv1 -o results.json ... ...",
        "jsonoutputversion": "1.00",
        "server": "127.0.0.1",
        "service": "http-post-form",
        "software": "Hydra",
        "version": "v8.5"
    },
    "quantityfound": 2,
    "results": [
        {
            "host": "127.0.0.1",
            "login": "bill@example.com",
            "password": "bill",
            "port": 9999,
            "service": "http-post-form"
        },
        {
            "host": "127.0.0.1",
            "login": "joe@example.com",
            "password": "joe",
            "port": 9999,
            "service": "http-post-form"
        }
    ],
    "success": false
}
```


SPEED
-----
through the parallelizing feature, this password cracker tool can be very
fast, however it depends on the protocol. The fastest are generally POP3
and FTP.
Experiment with the task option (-t) to speed things up! The higher - the
faster ;-) (but too high - and it disables the service)



STATISTICS
----------
Run against a SuSE Linux 7.2 on localhost with a "-C FILE" containing
295 entries (294 tries invalid logins, 1 valid). Every test was run three
times (only for "1 task" just once), and the average noted down.

```
			P A R A L L E L    T A S K S
SERVICE	1	4	8	16	32	50	64	100	128
------- --------------------------------------------------------------------
telnet	23:20	5:58	2:58	1:34	1:05	0:33	0:45*	0:25*	0:55*
ftp	45:54	11:51	5:54	3:06	1:25	0:58	0:46	0:29	0:32

imap	31:05	7:41	3:51	1:58	1:01	0:39	0:32	0:25	0:21
```

(*)
Note: telnet timings can be VERY different for 64 to 128 tasks! e.g. with
128 tasks, running four times resulted in timings between 28 and 97 seconds!
The reason for this is unknown...

guesses per task (rounded up):
	
  295	74	38	19	10	6	5	3	3

guesses possible per connect (depends on the server software and config):
	
  telnet	4
	ftp	6
	pop3	1
	imap	3
