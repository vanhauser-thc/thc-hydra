Release v4.0
############
#
# This is a summary of changes of the D1 to D5 beta releases and shows
# what makes v4.0 different from 3.1.
# Have fun. Lots of it.
#
# By the way: I need someone to program a nice GTK frontend for hydra,
# would YOU like to do that and receive the fame? Send an email to vh@thc.org !
#
* For the first time there is not only a UNIX/source release but additionally:
   ! Windows release (cygwin compile with dll's)
   ! PalmPilot release
   ! ARM processor release (for all your Zaurus, iPaq etc. running Linux)
* There are new service attack modules:
   ! ms-sql
   ! sap r/3 (requires a library)
   ! ssh v2 (requires a library)
* Enhancements/Fixes to service attack modules:
   ! vnc module didnt work correctly, fixed
   ! mysql module supports newer versions now
   ! http module received a minor fix and has better virtual host support now
   ! http-proxy supports now an optional URL
   ! socks5 checks now for false positives and daemons without authentication
* The core code (hydra.c) was rewritten from scratch
   ! rewrote the internal distribution functions from scratch. code is now
     safer, less error prone, easier to read.
   ! multiple target support rewritten which now includes intelligent load
     balancing based on success, error and load rate
   ! intelligently detect maximum connect numbers for services (per server if
     multiple targets are used)
   ! intelligent restore file writing
   ! Faster (up to 15%)
   ! Full Cygwin and Cygwin IPv6 support
* added new tool: pw-inspector - it can be used to just try passwords which
  matches the target's password policy
#
# This should be more than enough! :-)
#

... the rest below is history ...

v3.0 (FEBRUARY 2004)		PUBLIC RELEASE
* added a restore function to enable you to continue aborted/crashed

* added HTTP and SSL/CONNECT proxy support. SSL/CONNECT proxy support works
  for *all* TCP protocols, you just need to find a proxy which allows you to

  following syntax is valid: HYDRA_PROXY_HTTP="http://123.45.67.89:8080/"
  Same for HYDRA_PROXY_CONNECT.
  If you require authentication for the proxy, use the HYDRA_PROXY_AUTH
  environment variable:
    HYDRA_PROXY_AUTH="login:password"
